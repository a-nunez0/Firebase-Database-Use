# Overview

For this cloud database assignment I decided to use firebase to store some kind of data from a user.

To get the data from the user I decided to make a small app using react but it's also connected with firebase that way their data goes straight to the firebase cloud.

The purpose of writting this react app was to learn how to use firebase, their useful applications, and how to store data in a cloud.

# Cloud Database

The database I'm using is firebase, it lets you store user data and it also shows you analytics from your website/app but it also helps you with logins and signups.

# Development Environment

The programming language used in this programs is mostly javascript, html and css, but the library used was React.

# Useful Websites

- [React App]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/))
- [W3School]([http://url.link.goes.here](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP))

# Future Work

- I need to learn how to import a function in react.
- I need to learn the commands to properly start the app. 
- I need to learn a little bit more of JavaScript, I understand almost everything but a few things.
